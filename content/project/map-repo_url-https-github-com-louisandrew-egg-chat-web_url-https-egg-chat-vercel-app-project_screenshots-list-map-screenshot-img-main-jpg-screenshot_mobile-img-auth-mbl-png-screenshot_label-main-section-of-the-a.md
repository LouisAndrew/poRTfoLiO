  Egg.Chat is a simple chat application built with React and Firebase.
  Technologies used in this application is React on the front end, Firebase as
  the Backend for authentication purposes and as database provider, React
  Context API as state management tool and Rebass as the component library. 


  A lot of aspects in this application is inspired by the web based Whatsapp and I tried to make it as mobile-friendly as possible. 3 sample users are also provided to grant access to the application without having to sign in using the Google Auth Provider.


  Furthermore, while building this app, I also learnt a lot about UML Diagram in my university and decided to create a UML Diagram of this app to help me structure the app better and design better architecture for the app. Here's the [LINK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q8gMungAy39cV05RdNQbvpw12bDsCmMm/view?usp=sharing) to the UML Diagram
