    Pong is one of my earliest projects and is a simple e-commerce like webstite
    to showcase different type of beers provided by [the Punk
    API](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2). 


    The website doesn't have other functionality rather than just fetching some data from remote APIs and rendering it as a card like component. Every beer from the Punk API has their own page which contains information about the beer, its ingredients, brewing tips and some additional informations.


    Technologies used in this projects are React, NextJS for easier dynamic routing and styled-components as the CSS-in-JS library.
