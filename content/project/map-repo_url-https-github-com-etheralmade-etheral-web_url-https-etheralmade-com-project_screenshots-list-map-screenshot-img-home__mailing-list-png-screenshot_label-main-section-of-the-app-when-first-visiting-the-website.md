  This is the biggest project I've ever done. The website was made for a
  business called etheral (IG:
  [@etheralmade](https://www.instagram.com/etheralmade/)) that sells jewelleries
  in Indonesia. So client initially wanted an e-commerce website with
  functionalities such as payment gateway, content management, mailing list
  subscription and the ability to write blog posts.


  I've used firebase as the database and authentication provider for this application. Other than that, some lambda / serverless functions also need to be programmed to do some tasks that can't be achieved merely on the front end such as mailing list subscription ([mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/)), notifying admin when an order when is paid, payment integration ([ipaymu](https://ipaymu.com/)) and so on. 


  For faster development time, a styling library, [Rebass ](https://rebassjs.org/)was used here and helpers such as [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) are needed to make the development less complicated. A lot of efforts were poured into this project and a dedicated case study is made for this project.
